# Password-Changer This is a password changer page where you can use this code for changing the password for any website.

This is written in HTML and Typescript.

This also contains all the parts that contain in a school website like a fee-payment and etc..

But I have only uploaded the change-password part for a Student.If you want you can delete/remove the unnecessary parts.

To run You must have node.js installed in your PC or Laptop.

To run an Angular file use "ng serve student-change-password".
